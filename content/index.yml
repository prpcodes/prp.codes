about:
  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    I'm Philipp, a fullstack developer based in Austria with over 5 years of experience building web applications for startups and established companies.

    I started with a technical apprenticeship in electrical systems before transitioning to software development in 2020. Since then, I've worked across the full stack - building responsive frontends with React and Vue, developing backends with Python and Django, and deploying on AWS infrastructure.

    Recently, I've focused on AI-powered applications. I built a recruiting platform that automates candidate-job matching and a podcast marketing tool that uses NLP to match products with relevant content. I enjoy projects where AI solves real business problems.
    At Shiftable, I work with clients across different industries building custom web applications. I handle the full development lifecycle - from architecture and coding to deployment.
