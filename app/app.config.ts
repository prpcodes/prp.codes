  about: {
    title: 'About Me',
    description: 'I\'m Philipp, a fullstack developer based in Austria with over 5 years of experience building web applications for startups and established companies. I started with a technical apprenticeship in electrical systems before transitioning to a fulltime software development role in 2022. Since then, I\'ve worked across the full stack - building responsive frontends with React/Next or Vue/Nuxt, developing backends with Python and Django. For hosting, I mainly choose Docker and a good old VPS, you know, the boring way, but if the project needs it, I\'m also familiar with serverless architectures. Recently, I\'ve moved focus on AI-powered applications, so I built a recruiting platform that automates candidate-job matching and a podcast marketing tool that uses NLP to match products with relevant content. I enjoy projects where AI solves real business problems, instead of it being used just for hype.'
